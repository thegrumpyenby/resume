Besides creating written and video content, I run the Scaler Writer program, focusing on supporting engineers as they write and tell their stories. I help with everything from finding the narrative hook to creating structure and improving writing. I work closely with engineers, product managers, and product marketing managers from various teams. I also initiated video content at Scaleway, starting the interview series “Scalers go Open Source”.
