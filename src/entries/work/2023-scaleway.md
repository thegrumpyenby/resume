Besides writing, editing, and reviewing content, I am supporting engineers to write and tell their stories through the Scaler Writer program â€” helping with everything from finding the narrative hook to creating structure and improving writing. I work closely with engineers throughout the Scaleway ecosystem as well as with my colleagues in DevRel.
