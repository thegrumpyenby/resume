Wiener Zeitung is one of Austria’s biggest (and oldest) national broadsheets. I worked in the Local/Vienna department, creating a wide range of content. I wrote daily content, often on a very short deadline, but also created extensive, research-based features on topics such as youth trends, extreme sports, environmental issues and technology. I liaised with contacts, covered press conferences, occasionally co-authored pieces with colleagues, and edited and proofread other people’s work on a daily basis.
