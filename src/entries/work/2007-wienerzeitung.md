Wiener Zeitung is one of Austria’s biggest (and oldest) national broadsheets. I worked in the Local/Vienna department, creating a wide range of content. I wrote daily content, often on a very short deadline, occasionally co-writing with colleagues, but also created extensive, research-based features on topics such as youth trends, extreme sports,
environmental issues and technology. Of course, I liaised with contacts, covered press conferences, and edited and proofread other people’s work as well.
