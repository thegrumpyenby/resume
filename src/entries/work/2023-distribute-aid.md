I’m building and run Distribute Aid’s open source outreach program (first cohort: Jan 2024) that provides a well-structured introduction to open source while also making impactful contributions to facilitate Distribute Aid’s humanitarian aid work. My role is to build the program in public, making sure everyone (mentors, participants, and the wider Distribute Aid team) is getting the most use out of the program and that our work actually supports the humanitarian aid work of Distribute Aid. My work involves both project and people management, finding the right people for the right jobs, and creating a big impact with few resources.
