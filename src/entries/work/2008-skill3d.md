Skill3D is Austria’s biggest eSports agency specialising in eSport and gaming events. As Skill3D’s first ever PR hire, I set up press work procedures at the company. I wrote press releases and blog posts, monitored media coverage, managed media contacts, and liaised with journalists during our events. I also initiated and organised the “Games Don’t Kill” exhibition at Museumsquartier Wien in June 2009, which attracted a lot of attention and was covered by multiple media outlets.
