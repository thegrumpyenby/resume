I’m as good as finished with <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/freecodecamp-responsive-web-design-34059" target="blank">Class Central’s Web Development Bootcamp</a>. Over the course of six weeks, I learned HTML and CSS through the combination of FreeCodeCamp’s self-paced New Responsive Web Design classes and live-streamed lessons by Jessica Rose. I’ve <a href="https://github.com/stars/thegrumpyenby/lists/freecodecamp-projects">finished multiple projects</a> varying in scope and have also engaged in my cohort’s Discord channel, where I tried to help out others wherever I could — which, in turn, has also helped my own learning progress. At this point in time, I just have to hand in my very last project.
