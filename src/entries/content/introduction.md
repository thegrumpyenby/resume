---

Iâ€™m a startup consultant with 6+ years of experience working with companies on their technical brand. I create fantastic content, have a strategic mindset, and a knack for asking the right questions. I work exceptionally well with developers and love learning new things. I also enjoy public speaking and am a natural networker with a lot of empathy and a keen interest in DE&I.
