Hi! I’m Kai, and I would love to build and grow your company’s technical content department! I have a strategic mindset and a knack for understanding and communicating technical topics. I’m an enabler at heart and can help your engineers create developer-focused content that matters for your audience. 
<br> Aside from providing engineers with editorial support, I create fantastic content of all types (blog posts, live streams, podcasts, etc.). I’m also a skilled interviewer, thanks to my background in journalism, my endless curiosity and eagerness to learn new things and, last but not at all least, my innate empathy.
<br>I enjoy public speaking and am a natural networker. I’m involved and volunteer in various online tech communities and have a keen interest in Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI), mental health, and neurodiversity.
