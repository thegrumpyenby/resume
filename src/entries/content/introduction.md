Hi! I’m Kai, and **I would love to build and/or grow your company’s technical content department** in part through a programme dedicated to helping engineers create relevant content. Sure, I can write great content for developers myself but, what’s more important, **I can help your engineers create developer-focused content**.

<br>I believe that the best content — the content that matters most to your audience — usually comes from your developers. I’ve noticed that **plenty of engineers would *love* to communicate their ideas and experiences** through blog posts. They just need a little bit of help with the writing, be it through hands-on editing, interviews, or just some guidance getting over that blank-page syndrome. 

<br>Explaining something that they’ve learned or built also helps developers gain more clarity on a topic, and (much to my delight) it can be a real confidence booster for them as well.

<br>Here are just a few articles that I was heavily involved in, helping engineers put what matters to them on the page. As you can see, I’m capable of covering a wide variety of technical topics:
[*] [A primer on effective monitoring practices](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/effective-monitoring-practices/)
* [Isolate resources across Availability Zones with Virtual Private Cloud](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/virtual-private-cloud-public-beta/)
* [Creating Cockpit: From ecosystem tool to observability product](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/cockpit-observability-tool-product/)
* [Graduating from Docker to Kubernetes](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/from-docker-to-kubernetes/)
* [Tripling the lifespan of servers: why we retrofitted 14,000 servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/the-transformers-project/)
* [Giving back to Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/foss-giving-back/)

<br> Aside from providing engineers with editorial support, I create fantastic content of all types (blog posts, live streams, podcasts, etc.). I have a strategic mindset and a knack for understanding and communicating technical topics. I’m also a skilled interviewer thanks to my background in journalism, my empathy, and my endless curiosity and eagerness to learn new things.

I currently work more with engineers than I write my own posts. But when I do, I bring my own voice to my writing — the comment I get the most regarding my posts and newsletters is “so authentic”. But don’t take everyone else’s word for it; have a read yourself:
* [Why we used open-source software to build Cockpit, our observability product](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/cockpit-scaleway-observability-product/)
* [Get started with Cockpit: use cases for Scaleway Observability](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/cockpit-observability-use-cases/)

<br>Additionally, I’m one of those oddballs who enjoy public speaking. I love giving talks (catch me at [DevRelCon London](https://london-2023.devrelcon.dev/speaker/kai-katschthaler/) in September 2023!) and doing live streams or podcasts, and moderating events. I’m involved and volunteer in various online tech communities and have a keen interest in Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI), mental health, and neurodiversity.

<br>Watch my most recent talk [“How to Talk About Mental Health Without Losing Your Mind” at You Got This Broadcasting Service Conference](https://yougotthis.io/library/talk-about-mental-health-combat-stigma).
