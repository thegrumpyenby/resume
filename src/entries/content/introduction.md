title: About Me
---

I’m a startup consultant with 6+ years of experience working with companies on their technical brand. My work is situated at the intersection of tech, marketing and product. I care about your Developer Relations but also about your general company culture and the image you project externally. Instead of quick fixes, we want long-term, sustainable change that creates brand loyalty, both internally and externally.
<br>I create fantastic content, have a strategic mindset, and a knack for asking the right questions. I work exceptionally well with developers and love learning new things. I also enjoy public speaking and am a natural networker with a lot of empathy and a keen interest in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI).
