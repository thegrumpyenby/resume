Hi, I’m Kai! I would love to build and/or grow your company’s technical content  and help your engineers create relevant content.
### Helping developers create content *for* developers
The content that matters most to your audience comes from your developers. Many engineers would *love* to communicate their ideas and experiences through blog posts. They just need a bit of help with the writing, be it through hands-on editing, interviews, or just some guidance getting over that blank-page syndrome. 

Explaining something that they’ve learned or built also helps developers gain more clarity on a topic, and it can be a real confidence booster for them as well.

Here are just a few examples of articles that I’ve recently been involved with, helping engineers put what matters to them on the page, covering a wide variety of technical topics:

☞ [A primer on effective monitoring practices](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/effective-monitoring-practices/)
☞ [Isolate resources across Availability Zones with Virtual Private Cloud](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/virtual-private-cloud-public-beta/)
✪ [Creating Cockpit: From ecosystem tool to observability product](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/cockpit-observability-tool-product/)
✪ [Graduating from Docker to Kubernetes](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/from-docker-to-kubernetes/)
‣ [Tripling the lifespan of servers: why we retrofitted 14,000 servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/the-transformers-project/)
‣ [Giving back to Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/foss-giving-back/)

### Content whiz with a journo background
Aside from providing engineers with editorial support, I create fantastic content (blog posts, live streams, podcasts, etc.). I have a strategic mindset and a knack for understanding and communicating technical topics. I’m also a skilled interviewer thanks to my background in journalism, my empathy, and my endless curiosity and eagerness to learn new things.

I currently work more with engineers than I write my own posts. But when I do, I bring my own voice to the content:
• [Why we used open-source software to build Cockpit, our observability product](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/cockpit-scaleway-observability-product/)
• [Get started with Cockpit: use cases for Scaleway Observability](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/cockpit-observability-use-cases/)

### Engaging public speaker
I’m one of those oddballs who genuinely enjoy public speaking. I love giving talks (catch me at [DevRelCon London](https://london-2023.devrelcon.dev/speaker/kai-katschthaler/) in September 2023!), doing live streams or podcasts, and moderating events. I’m involved with and volunteer in various online tech communities and have a keen interest in Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI), mental health, and neurodiversity.

Watch my most recent talk [“How to Talk About Mental Health Without Losing Your Mind” at You Got This Broadcasting Service Conference](https://yougotthis.io/library/talk-about-mental-health-combat-stigma).
