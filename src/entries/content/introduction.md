title: About Me
---

I’m a tech content specialist with 10 years of experience working with tech companies and a track record of learning new technologies quickly. My work is often situated at the intersection of tech, marketing, and product.
<br>
I create fantastic content, have a strategic mindset, and a knack for asking the right questions. This allows me to find the best ways to communicate technological content of different complexities to various audiences. I also love collaborating with engineers and others to help them tell their stories.
<br>
I care deeply about company culture and believe it’s the path to creating sustainable brand loyalty, both internally and externally.
<br>
I enjoy public speaking and am a natural networker with a lot of empathy and a keen interest in Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI).
