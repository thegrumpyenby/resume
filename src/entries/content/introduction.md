title: About Me

Hi, I’m Kai! I’m a Jack-of-all-Trades working at the intersection of tech, marketing, and product. I help product teams explain what they’re working on, communicate complex technical topics, and create clear communication for both internal and external use. I can also devise a developer content strategy and build a technical content team around that, putting engineers’ expertise to good use by helping them create relevant content that other developers will love. I’m also a skilled interviewer thanks to my background in journalism and my endless curiosity and eagerness to learn new things. I enjoy public speaking, whether it’s giving talks, moderating panels, or interviewing people on livestreams and podcasts.

### Managing projects and people with empathy
I currently run Open Source Explorers at Distribute Aid. Open Source Explorers is an outreach program that provides a well-structured introduction to open source for developers, designers, technical writers, etc., specifically those from marginalised groups. Our participants make impactful contributions to Distribute Aid’s technical projects, facilitating Distribute Aid’s humanitarian aid work. Our hope is that many OSE participants will stick around in open source, either with Distribute Aid or by joining other open-source communities.

While being a volunteer position, my work as Program Lead of the Open Source Explorers program involves a high degree of organisation and engagement. It also requires a bunch of humility, because we’re building this program in public. So any mistakes we make, we make out in the open. As always with volunteering, you have to make a lot of things work with few resources. But that gives me ample opportunites to learn and grow as a manager as I try to make the Open Source Explorers program an enjoyable and worthy experience for participants, mentors, and our entire team.
