Hi, I‚Äôm Kai!

I‚Äôm a Jack-of-all-Trades working at the intersection of tech, marketing, and product. I help product teams explain what they‚Äôre working on, communicate complex technical topics, and create clear communication for internal and external use. I can devise a developer content strategy and build a technical content team, putting engineers‚Äô expertise to good use by helping them create relevant content that other developers will love.

I‚Äôm also a skilled interviewer thanks to my background in journalism and my endless curiosity and eagerness to learn new things. I enjoy public speaking, whether it‚Äôs giving talks, moderating panels, or interviewing people on livestreams and podcasts.

### Managing projects and people with empathy
I currently run Open Source Explorers at [Distribute Aid](https://distributeaid.org). Open Source Explorers is an outreach program that provides a well-structured introduction to open source for developers, designers, technical writers, etc. ‚Äî specifically those from marginalised groups. Our participants make impactful contributions to Distribute Aid‚Äôs technical projects, facilitating Distribute Aid‚Äôs humanitarian aid work. Our hope is that many OSE participants will stick around in open source, either with Distribute Aid or by joining other open-source communities.

While being a volunteer position, my work as Program Lead of the Open Source Explorers program involves a high degree of organisation and engagement. It also requires humility, because [we‚Äôre building the program in public](https://schalkneethling.substack.com/p/distribute-aid-the-open-source-path). So any mistakes we make, we make out in the open. As always with volunteering, you have to make a lot of things work with few resources. But that gives me ample opportunites to learn and grow as a manager as I try to make the Open Source Explorers program an enjoyable and worthy experience for participants, mentors, and our entire team.

I‚Äôd love to talk about how my varied skill set could fit in with your company!
